Includes the First task: Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
Objective: Clean and prepare a raw dataset (with nulls, duplicates, inconsistent formats).
Converted the Date_Added column to datetime format using pd.to_datetime(), handling invalid entries with errors='coerce'.

Filled missing values in the Date_Added column with a default date (2023-01-01) to ensure consistency in time-based analysis.

Standardized country names, including handling multiple countries in a single row, by splitting entries, mapping them to short codes (e.g., 'India' â†’ 'IN'), and rejoining them.

Checked and fixed data types: Converted age to numeric format, ensured date fields are proper datetime objects, and cleaned text data where needed.

Removed duplicate rows using .drop_duplicates() to maintain data integrity.

Dropped unnecessary columns like country_cleaned and country_code after standardization.

Formatted Date_Added for display as YYYY-MM-DD using .dt.strftime('%Y-%m-%d').
